# What is Spleeter ?

[Spleeter by Deezer](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) is a source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow.
It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources)
and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :

Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation (2 stems)
Vocals / drums / bass / other separation (4 stems)
Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation (5 stems)
2 stems and 4 stems models have high performances on the musdb dataset.

Spleeter is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.

We designed Spleeter so you can use it straight from command line as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a Python library. It can be installed with Conda, with pip or be used with Docker.
